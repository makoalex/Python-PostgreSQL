JOINs are key elements in relational databases
      help retrieve important data from multiple tables at once
      treat rows of data  like sets in Python

one of the main things we can do with sets in Python is INTERSECT
 we can do that in tables as well, use an intersect function on columns
         I.  INNER JOIN
                 we can intersect data  from one table with another where they match.
                 intersect data from one row with another where they match the data
          SYNTAX:
                   select* from table name INNER JOIN table name ON table name. column name = table name. column name
           pgadmin4: select* from
LEFT JOIN - return all records from the left table(table1 ) and the records that match from the right table (table2)
            if they don't match the data from the right table is blank
                SYNTAX : select* or COLUMN NAME FROM TABLE1 RIGHT JOIN TABLE 2 ON TABLE1.COLUMN NAME = TABLE2. COLUMN NAME

RIGHT JOIN- returrn all records from teh right table(2) with matching records from the table on the left.
          - returns null if there are not matches

To get only the rows from the left or right table, we can use LEFT OR RIGHT JOIN, with the WHERE statement to filter
            select * from  FROM TABLE 1 LEFT/RIGHT JOIN TABLE 2 ON TABLE 1 .COLUMN NAME = TABLE 2. COLUMN NAME WHERE

FULL JOIN- will produce a result that contains a all rows from  table 1 and table 2 with matching values and corresponding
            null values where no match was found
           THE SYNTAX IS THE SAME WITH ONLY FULL JOIN INSTEAD OF LEFT JOIN
