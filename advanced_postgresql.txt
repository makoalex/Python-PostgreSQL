VIEW

IS A NAMED QUERY.
YOU CREATE A QUERY AND ASSIGN IT A NAME
it helps simply the complexity of the query, because you can also query a view wchich iis based on a query
using a simple select statement.
 SYNTAX:
            CREATE VIEW view name as QUERY
       then whenever you need that query you just use the view cretaed based of it
       EXAMPLE PGADMIN4:
                        CREATE VIEW sum AS
                        select customers.first_name, customers.last_name, sum(items.price)
                        from customers inner join purchases
                        on customers.id = purchases.customer_id
                        inner join items on items.id= purchases.item_id
                        group by customers.first_name, customers.last_name

we can insert into view as well:- if a view was GROUPED BY it cannot be inserted into
                        INSERT INTO VIEW NAME (COLUMN 1 COLUMN, 2...) VALUES ( FOR COLUMN 1, COLUMN 2)
                        INSERT INTO sum (id, name, price) VALUES(9, 'LAPTOP', 1000)

we can create a VIEW  where we filter through the prices for example
                                select name, price from items where items.price >= 100
                                     - but this will not check when we want to insert new data if the price is over 100
             - instead we have to write a new VIEW :
                                                 CREATE VIEW view_name AS
                                                 select name, price from items where items.price> 100 +
                                                  WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION
                                                       - this makes sure that each of the parts of the where clause  is
                                                         being checked for
we can create A VIEW BASED OF A VIEW
              twe can use a view without any check like int the first example
                                 CREATE VIEW expensive_stuff AS
                                select name, price from items where items.price >= 1000
                                        -   THEN  based of this we create another view with a check
                                        CREATE VIEW non  ordinary_stuff AS
                                        SELECT* FROM  expensive_stuff where price < 10000
               in the ex above, if we use the WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION, WE WILL CHECK JUST THE LOCAL WHERE CLAUSE
               but if we use WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION , WE CAN CHECK THE CLAUSE OF THE PREVIOUS WHERE CLAUSE WHERE THE
               PRICE IS >= 100

THE CUSTOMER WITH THE HIGHEST SALE IN PGADMIN4 EXAMPLE
                    select customers.first_name, customers.last_name,
                    sum(items.price )
                    from items inner join purchases on items.id = purchases.item_id
                    inner join customers
                    on customers.id = purchases.customer_id
                    group by customers.id
                    order by sum(items.price) desc limit


 HAVING
 the HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE clause cannot be used with aggregated function (after group by for ex.)
       SYNTAX:
             SELECT column name from table name, where condition/ join condition
             GROUP BY condition
             HAVING condition
             ORDER BY CONDITION

                 IN THE PGADMIN4 EXAMPLE IF WE WANT TO FILTER THE CUSTOMER HAVING OVER 2 PURCHASES:
                        SELECT customers.last_name, customers.first_name, count(purchases.id) as purch_c
                        FROM customers inner join purchases
                        ON customers.id = purchases.customer_id
                        GROUP BY customers.id
                        HAVING count(urchases.id)>2
                        ORDER BY purch_c DESC
