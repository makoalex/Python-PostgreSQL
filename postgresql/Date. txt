DATE
Postgresql usees 4 bytes to store a data value
the data is formatted in the YEAR- MONTH- DAY format automatically ISO8601

if we want to create a table that has a date column and we want to use the current date as a default value, we just add:
            CREATE TABLE table name ( column 1,
                                      column 2,
                                      column 3(the one with the date)-DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT DATE )
            example: CREATE TABLE documents ( doc_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                                              header_text varchar (255) NOT NULL,
                                              posting_date date NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT DATE )
DATE FUNCTIONS

NOW:- is used to get the current date and time
    SYNTAX :
                SELECT  NOW()
                    if we want the current date only, without the time WE ADD :: AND date
                          SELECT NOW():: date
    - TO CHAR FUNCTION- to output the value to a format we want
                      -it takes 2 parameters: - the value you want to format
                                              - the template that defines the output format
                                                     SELECT TO_CHAR(NOW() 'DD-MM-YYY HH:MM:SS')
                                              - or to display the date : 17 april 2020:
                                                      SELECT TO_CHAR (NOW():: date 'dd Mon yyyy')
                                                      SELECT TO_CHAR(NOW()):: DATE 'DAY, DD-MM-YYYY')
                                                               in order to remove the space that will show up after the day,
                                                               we write : FMDAY
                                                               we can write the day as DDth and get the correct ending

     the  '-' operator used as in subtraction to get the  interval between 2 dates
                for example we can have a COLUMN WITH THE HIRE DATES  of employees and want to find the days of work
                  we sue this syntax:
                                        NOW()- HIRE DATE

AGE:- calculate the  age at the current date in years, months and days
        say we have a BIRTH OF DATE COLUMN WE CAN USE THE AGE FUNCTION GOT GET ages of employees:
                            AGE(BIRTH_DAY)

     - if we give 2 parameters it will extract the second for the first
         example. if we want to find the age at a certain time, we can write 2 parameters in the AGE function
             AGE('2020-10-23', birth_day) WHERE BIRTH_DAY IS THE COLUMN IN OUR TABLE

EXTRACT:-  to get the day, month, year, from a date value
                
POSTGRESQL haa a few data types that help us store dates :

TIMESTAMP
is a date type that allows to store date and time but IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY TIME ZONE
TIMESTAMPTZ is the timestamp WITH TIME ZONE
postgres stores timestamptz in UTC value:
                                        when you insert values into a TIMESTAMPTZ COLUMN, POSGRESQL CONVERTS THE VLAUE
                                        into a UTC VALUE and stores it in the table
