Data modeling-  represents real world entities such as customers, service, products and the relation between them
             - it provides an abstraction for the relations in the database
             -plays and important role in achieving data consistency across interactive systems
                       EX: if an entity is not defined or is poorly defined, it will lead to inconsistent data ( having one table
                       with the key client and one with the attribute customer)
I. CONCEPTUAL DATA MODELING
        defines what a system contains, puts in place the semantics and is a link between developers and business depart.
II. LOGIC DATA MODEL
        describes how the system should be implemented, regardless of the DBMS
        the purpose is to develop a technical map of rules and  data structures
III. PHYSICAL DATA MODELING- describes how the system will be implemented, using a specific DBMS
                            the purpose is the actual creation o the database
