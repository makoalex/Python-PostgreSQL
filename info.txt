 in order to select a table from  a given database we can write: SELECT from + NAME OF  THE TABLE
 the "*" means that all the table will be returned.
II. In order to get only a column from the table, we can specify by writing for example :
                    SELECT+  NAME OF TABLE+ .NAME EOF THE COLUMN from name of the table
    we can have multiple selection by simply adding the name of the next column separated by ","
                    in the pgadmmin4 database:
                                   SELECT customers.first_name, customers.last_name from customers
III. AS- ALIAS - If we want the name of the columns to be presented in another way, we can use an ALIAS, and rename the columns:
                    for the pgadmin4 ex:
                                  Select customers.fist_name as "Fist Name", customers.last_name as "Last Name" from customers
                                  SELECT TABLE NAME.COLUMN NAME as "ALIAS NAME" from NAME OF THE TABLE
IV. WHERE- Just like in Sqlite, we can use WHERE to filter through the attributes
                                select NAME OF THE TABLE.NAME OF THE COLUMN from NAME OF THE TABLE, where NAME OF THE COLUMN = NAME OF THE ATTRIBUTE
                                 PGADMIN4 EXAMPLE:
                                  Select customers.first_name from customers where first_name = 'Anna'
                         we can also add the Alias as well:
                                  Select customer.first_name as " First Name" from customers Where first_name = 'Anna'
V. LIMIT- if we want to limit the amount of results we get back we can use LIMIT + integer

VI. UPDATE-To update an attribute, we have to use :
                                             UPDATE+ NAME OF TABLE+ SET+ NEW VALUE OF ATTRIBUTE WE WANT TO CHANGE+ WHERE
                                                                                                                OLD VALUE OF ATTRIBUTE WE WAN1T TO CHANGE
                                                 PGADMIN4 EX: UPDATE items SET price = 4.00 WHERE price = 3.50
                                                             or we can use other identifiers from the  tuple
                                                             UPDATE items SET price = 4.00 WHERE name = 'INK'
                   NOTA BENE!!
                               if we forget to filter using WHERE  we will overwrite all the data
VII. DELETE can be used to delete from tables, but must have the WHERE filter.
                if we have relational tables, we must refer to one of the the tables where the attribute is used and delete from there first.
VIII. LIKE/ %/_ - each of these is used to help us filter through the attributes.
                LIKE:- is used in the statement after WHERE:
                                                          SELECT * FROM TABLE NAME WHERE ATTRIBUTE NAME LIKE
                     is combined with either % or _ to filter :
                                          % represents any number of characters
                                          - represents one single character
                                      Example: extracting the name SCOTT:
                                                                 SELECT * from CUSTOMERS WHERE last_name LIKE '%t%'
                                                                                    name that has a T with any number of characters before and after
                                                                 SELECT* FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE last_name like '___tt'-3 underscores for each charact
