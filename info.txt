 in order to select a table from  a given database we can write: SELECT from + NAME OF  THE TABLE
 the "*" means that all the table will be returned.
II. In order to get only a column from the table, we can specify by writing for example :
                    SELECT+  NAME OF TABLE+ .NAME EOF THE COLUMN from name of the table
    we can have multiple selection by simply adding the name of the next column separated by ","
                    in the pgadmmin4 database:
                                   SELECT customers.first_name, customers.last_name from customers
III. If we want the name of the columns to be presented in another way, we can use an ALIAS, and rename the columns:
                    for the pgadmin4 ex:
                                  Select customers.fist_name as "Fist Name", customers.last_name as "Last Name" from customers
                                  SELECT TABLE NAME.COLUMN NAME as "ALIAS NAME" from NAME OF THE TABLE
IV. Just like in Sqlite, we can use WHERE to filter through the attributes
                                select NAME OF THE TABLE.NAME OF THE COLUMN from NAME OF THE TABLE, where NAME OF THE COLUMN = NAME OF THE ATTRIBUTE
                                 PGADMIN4 EXAMPLE:
                                  Select customers.first_name from customers where first_name = 'Anna'
                         we can also add the Alias as well:
                                  Select customer.first_name as " First Name" from customers Where first_name = 'Anna'
